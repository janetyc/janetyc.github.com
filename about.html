<div id="about">
I am currently a fourth year PhD candidate in computer science in National Taiwan University. I am interested in the problems in human computer interaction, crowdsourcing and social computing. Currently I work on the design of crowdsourcing systems that leverage the power of the crowd to accomplish the tasks too hard for machine or a single expert. Inspired by learning science, I designed several scaffolding mechanisms for guiding the crowd to produce high-quality results. The ideas had been applied on the domains of interpreting user interface and facilitating physical sensing. For the following academic year, I would like to explore the potential of apprenticeship to facilitate the workersâ€™ abilities and improve the workplace performance.

I am PhD candidate in computer science in National Taiwan University. I am interested in the problems in human computer interaction, crowdsourcing and social computing. Currently I work on the design of crowdsourcing systems that leverage the power of the crowd to accomplish the tasks too hard for machine or a single expert. Inspired by learning science, I designed several scaffolding mechanisms for guiding the crowd to produce high-quality results. The ideas had been applied on the domains of user interface interpretation, physical sensing, and complex creative tasks solving. <br/><br/>
I passed my <u>PhD thesis proposal</u> (<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/janetyc/designing-for-complex-creative-task-solving">slides</a>) on October 13th, 2017. I expect to graduate in <u>May, 2018</u>.

*People can recall the experience in Taiwan’s nightmarket and enjoy the happy atmosphere through a pinball game.*

Everyone has a special night market experience in Taiwan. It’s so full of energy and excitement. In this project, we want to construct a common memory of night market experience. We utilize a common game “Pinball" as a special point for storytelling and utilize large amounts of related images and voices to evoke your past memory. Through this game, people can enjoy night market atmosphere again and connect other people who have the same experience.

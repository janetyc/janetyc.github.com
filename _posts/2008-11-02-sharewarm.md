*ShareWarm is a affective object to help you deliver a implicit and warm message to someone else in a critical situation.*

Sometimes you don’t really like be disturbed when you are busy, but you have to reply a message to your friends or families immediately. Due to this dilemma, we design a affective object to deliver your care and greeting to others who you care about without any text or voice. When you trigger a signal within mobile wireless device, this object which is placed at home could help you deliver your greeting to someone. “ShareWarm" is a affective service, which can shine for a while when a signal comes. Light means a warm message from someone who care about you.

We know that body movement could express semantic meaning to other people by Choreography, so we plan to design movement to our product. People can interact with product and realize the implicit message. Gesture of “hold up” has some semantic meanings such as “care,” “treasure,” and “sharing.” We plan to bring such message or meaning into people’s heart and let people know somebody send a warm message for him/her.

We collect the idea and feeling when people do “hold up” gesture and utilize fluid and shine material to create a prototype. When people send a implicit message, the objective would shine for a wile and decrease the brightness of the light. The light would emerge people to hold up it and deliver a semantic meaning to them. People would feel relax and warm when they realize the implicit message. ShareWarm help people build a close connection to their friends and families.

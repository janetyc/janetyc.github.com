title: Tag-based Profile Presentation with Semantic Relationship (2008)
year: 2007
---

People construct personal profiles for self presentation and for obtaining online services. Profiles consisting of simple factual data provide an inadequate description of the individual, as they are often incomplete, mostly subjective and cannot reflect dynamic changes. This thesis explores the idea of â€œyou-are-what-you-tag", namely, an individual can be effectively profiled by the tags associated with his/her social media. 

Specifically, this thesis proposes semantic tag-based profiles, profiles that can be represented as a set of semantically related and weighted tags. The strength of the semantic relationships between these tags are calculated using common sense computing and cooccurrence measurements. Moreover, different views of these profiles are visualized as tag clouds via a 3D switch effect. The proposed approach supports an intuitive and novel interface for people to browse/search through a social web site.

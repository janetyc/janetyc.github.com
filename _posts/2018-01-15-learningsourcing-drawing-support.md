To support the acquisition of drawing skills, this research explores a learnersourcing approach to generating personalized learning points. These are annotations containing a clip of a drawing process, a description, and an explanation. This paper presents ShareSketch, a web-based drawing system that enables learners to practice drawing, review the drawing process, and share their works with others. In particular, we propose the before/after-practice reflection workflow that allows learners to generate learning points before or after each short practice. We evaluated our reflec- tion workflows with eight self-motivated drawing learners. The results showed that our reflection workflow can guide learners to generate high-level subgoal or concept labels, low-level steps, and personalized coping strategies.

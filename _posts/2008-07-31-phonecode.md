PhoneCode (2008)
==============================

*PhoneCode is a visual and musical expression to identify the difference among people through a series of phone number.*

Cellphone is major communication device for delivering messages with other people.Each person is identify by a series of unique numbers. To get beyond the imagination of numeral codes, we convert a person’s cellphone number to an animation with music. People can be distinguished by this specific visual and musical expression.

In visual display, we use different themes to specify different telecommunication systems. In the beginning, the screen is composed of two colors and is encoded by binary code. The following is a piece of specific animation along with melody. The animation is accompanied with music based on the obtained tempo.

In music part, we use the rule of “Mozart’s Musikalisches Würfelspiel”(http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/Mozart/dice/) to generate an amazing music. It is a musical composition dice game which is created by Mozart and we apply the rule to map each number into a piece of music in order to create specific melody.

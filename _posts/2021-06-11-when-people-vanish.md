Designers have used everyday photos as stimuli to speculate alter- native scenarios about the future. Many studies have developed diverse ways of re-designing roles of an actor to stimulate scenario speculation; however, a lack of understandings of how the presence of an actor influences the scenario speculation process. Therefore, this work conducted a study that investigates how everyday photos with and without human actors affect people to speculate possible scenarios. We recruited 29 crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to generate 80 scenarios for two groups of photos (i.e., with-actor and non-actor photos). We analysed these scenarios and found that with-actor photos led people to speculate consistent scenarios around human actors and their activities. By contrast, non-actor photos allowed people to speculate the scenarios flexibly and diversely. These insights suggest a new design opportunity of using non-actor photos as potential materials to encourage people to generate diverse scenarios.

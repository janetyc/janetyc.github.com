As technology enabled new and faster modes of communication among people, it has become increasingly difficult to manage our social contacts effectively. Existing contact management tools lack the support for intelligent analysis of our social interactions. Therefore, we developed Déjà vu, an intelligent system of social network agents for managing and analyzing personal social contacts over the web.

Déjà vu is designed to help users record and retrieve contact information by tagging via a simple user interface. In addition, it helps users acquire additional knowledge about their contacts through social computing and tagging analysis. Our preliminary study showed that tagging is a subjective behavior and the proposed social tagging mechanism can compensate for individual difference.

This project got 2nd place in ImagineCup 2007 Software Design Competition(Taiwan site). Some technical detail was published in PRIMA2007[[pdf]()].

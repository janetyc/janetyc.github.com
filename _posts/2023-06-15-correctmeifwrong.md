Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into our everyday practice. However, limited research has explored users’ perceptions on AI outputs, especially for AI mistakes. Unexpected outputs from AI might lead to frustration and negative emotions. Thus, this work aims to investigate how AI outputs influence people’s perceptions and experiences in their everyday practice, particularly when they are given the opportunity to correct AI mistakes. In this work, we developed an AI-powered system capable of recognizing six types of beverages based on a photo and generating a data report summarizing people’s drinking behaviors. We conducted a study with 14 participants to understand user perception, experience and trust on AI predictions. Results showed that participants had higher trust on the system when given ability to modify AI outputs. Interestingly, incorrect predictions made by AI sparked people’s curiosity, leading them to speculate on the underlying reasons behind the AI model.

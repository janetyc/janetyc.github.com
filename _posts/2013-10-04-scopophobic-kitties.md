This installation showcases an office desk, a wonderland where a group of diligent kitties live happily and work industriously to make artifacts react to usersâ€™ eye gaze. Kitties are shy about being seen, but determined to keep everything in the wonderland moving after they hide behind.

The desk environment consists of two paper objects augmented by video projections and two devices with digital displays as well as other office stationaries. One desktop eye tracker was carefully setup in order to track gaze in the 3D physical space. Users sit in front of the desk and work as a normal office worker while objects and devices behave in different ways upon the presence and absence of eye gaze of users.

*Dinner of Luciérnaga* is an interdisciplinary project produced by more than ten talented members which include the director, dancer, choreographer, artist, interactive designer, sound designer, iPhone app engineer, image processing designer, stage designer and light designer. The goal of this project is to create new modes of interactive participation between the performers and audience through the use of an innovative iPhone application that links dancer to audience and audience to dancer. The application not only plays a key role in connecting the audience and dancer, but also uses an interesting sound generation application that enhances the spectators’ experience. It creates and shares special interactive experiences. Dinner of Luciérnaga is a story about the relationship of light and human in the digital era. It is a stunning performance in visuals and interactive process with focus on new interface that are put into use in authentic environments for validation by audience. This work was published in MM' 12.

StructFeed is a crowd-powered system that supports ESL writer to improve the unity of writing by generating structural feedback. The structural feedback consists of summary of writing issues, suggested steps, and aggregated crowd annotations of topic sentences and relevant keywords. Interesting findings is that people received StructFeed outperformed people received feedback from a single expert or a crowd worker.

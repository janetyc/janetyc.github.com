Detection of hateful memes depends on semantic understanding of the juxtaposition of short texts over image(s). Independently innocent texts or images may become hateful when they are combined in specific ways, which can be tricky for people without knowledge of the cultural context to understand. This work presents a new approach to generating explanations that help bridge the cultural gap in understanding hateful memes. Inspired by prior research, a three-stage crowdsourcing workflow is proposed to guide crowd workers to generate, annotate and revise explanations of hateful memes. To ensure the quality of explanations, a  self-assessment rubric is designed to evaluate the explanations using four criteria: target, clarity, explicitness, and utility. We evaluated the proposed workflow with a series of studies. The results showed that our proposed workflow generated high-quality explanations and supported people without prior knowledge gain more understanding and have better awarenesses than other methods.

*Virtual Blog: Interoperable Blog, Album and Bookmark System in Virtual Reality*

Internet provides all kinds of interesting services for us; however, too many resources which are stored in different websites confuse users, and it would be trouble for users to obtain services. We built a XML Web Service to integrate various services from different platforms, and we achieved the goal of Interoperability. Everyone could own a customized private space and could still communicate with other people. Moreover, I sensed a problem on these websites: users are lazy about managing personal data. To stimulate users to manage personal data, I got an idea of including fun and social incentives from online games, and implemented in my project.

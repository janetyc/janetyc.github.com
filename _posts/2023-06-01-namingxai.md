Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely adopted daily, and much academic effort has been directed to investigate the influencing factors of human acceptance and collaboration with it. Anthropomorphism can effectively foster positive evaluations of inanimate objects, and AI is no exception. The current study investigates how naming and personalizing an AI prototype’s appearance affect the human decision in a recipe ingredient recommendation system and finds that people are more likely to accept AI’s recommendation if they could name and customize its appearance than if they did not have the options.

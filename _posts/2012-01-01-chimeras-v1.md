title: Chimeras Sing a Song (2012)
---

*Chimeras sing a song* is an art work regarding the moving, living, perceptive, and receptive conditions of the human race in the digital era. Through the message transfer link between a mobile handheld device and matrix, Chimeras Sing a Song invoked the song of a siren from Greek mythology as a metaphor for the contradictory sense existing between humankind and digital communication. This art practice explores a technologically-built system amidst visual representations and conversions of information, space, time, and imagery as it becomes digitally encoded and reconstructed into a state of existence and method for perceiving the world.
